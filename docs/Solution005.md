# Smallest multiple

<blockquote>
<p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.</p>
<p>What is the smallest positive number that is <dfn title="divisible with no remainder">evenly divisible</dfn> by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?</p>
</blockquote>

## Solution

The smallest number n that is evenly divisible by every number in a set is also known as the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the set of numbers. The LCM of two natural numbers x and y is given by LCM(x, y) = x _ y / GCD(x, y). _(greatest common divider)\*.
