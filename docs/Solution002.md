# Even Fibonacci numbers

<blockquote>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>
<p><center>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</center></p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
</blockquote>

## Solution

There are different approaches to generate the fibonacci sequence. In this case we don't need high complex recursion or something. Instead we define two values for the current fibonacci number being processed and the next fibonacci number in the sequence. only if the current number is even, we add it to the result.
