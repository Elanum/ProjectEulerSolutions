# 10001st prime

<blockquote>
<p>By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.</p>
<p>What is the 10 001st prime number?</p>

## Solution

Simply check every incremented number starting at 2 if it's a prime number and if yes, increase the counter. if the 10 001st prime number is reached, return the increment.
